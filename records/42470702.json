      "reason": "The `Curl_dedotdotify` function in `dotdot.c` allocates memory using `malloc(inlen + 1)` and sometimes returns a `strdup`'d copy of the input string (`clone`) which was also based on `inlen`. If `inlen` is 0 (for an empty string), then `malloc(1)` is called for `out`, and `strdup(\"\")` for `clone`. Later, `Curl_dedotdotify` might return `clone` if the `input` is empty (dotdot.c:77). However, the critical issue is that `Curl_dedotdotify` might call `strdup` on `input` (dotdot.c:66) to create `clone`, and then if `input` had a '?' character, it modifies `clone` by null-terminating it earlier (`*queryp = 0;` at dotdot.c:86). But `Curl_dedotdotify` also has a path where it might return `clone` at dotdot.c:77. If `clone` (which was originally `strdup(input)`) is modified by `*queryp = 0;`, then `strlen(clone)` will be shorter than the originally allocated size for `clone`. When this (potentially truncated) `clone` is passed to `strdup` at `urlapi.c:1061`, and `Curl_dedotdotify` returns a pointer to the *original* `clone` buffer (which has the shorter `strlen`), but the function `seturl` expects a full URL part, `strdup` might read past the end of the buffer if the original `input` contained non-null characters after the '?' that were truncated by `*queryp = 0;`. This can happen if the `ptr` passed to `strdup` at `urlapi.c:1061` originated from `Curl_dedotdotify` returning the modified `clone` buffer. The overflow is due to `strdup` in `urlapi.c:1061` reading 4 bytes from a 3-byte allocation.",

However, if the Curl_dedotdotify function then returns this 'clone' pointer in certain edge cases (like when the string becomes empty after truncation), and if this truncated string is then used as input to strdup in curl_url_get, a heap-buffer-overflow can occur because the strdup operation might try to read past the new, shorter null terminator, into the original larger allocation.

If the `input` string contains a query part, `*queryp = 0;` (dotdot.c:87) null-terminates the `clone` string *before* the query, effectively shrinking the string length visible to `strdup` at urlapi.c:1061. However, the original `strdup` in `Curl_dedotdotify` allocated `strlen(input) + 1` bytes. If this `clone` is returned and `urlapi.c:1061` later calls `strdup(ptr)` where `ptr` is this `clone` (which has been truncated by setting a null terminator), and the original string was `input`, then `strdup` will attempt to read up to `strlen(ptr) + 1` bytes. If `ptr` was truncated, `strlen(ptr)` would be smaller than the original `strlen(input)`. If `urlapi.c:1061` expects to copy the *original full length* of `input` but `ptr` is a truncated `clone` that has `inlen` bytes allocated but has been null-terminated prematurely, `strdup` will allocate `strlen(ptr) + 1` bytes, which might be less than `inlen + 1`. This leads to a heap-buffer-overflow when the content of `ptr` is copied into the newly allocated buffer by `strdup` because the source string `ptr` is conceptually longer than the current `strlen(ptr)` implies due to the original allocation size. The simplest fix is to always ensure that `Curl_dedotdotify` returns a newly allocated string that matches the length of the string it intends to represent, preventing any confusion about allocated size versus effective string length.",
