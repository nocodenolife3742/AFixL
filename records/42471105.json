    "Reason for requesting line 214 of /src/harfbuzz/src/./hb-ot-color-cbdt-table.hh: The crash report states the overflow occurs at `hb-machinery.hh:675:13` which is the `BEInt<unsigned short, 2>::operator unsigned short()`. The callstack indicates this is called from `OT::IndexSubtableRecord::get_extents` at `hb-ot-color-cbdt-table.hh:214:36`. However, the previously provided code for `OT::IndexSubtable::get_extents` (which is line 171) doesn't access any BEInt objects. I need the code for `OT::IndexSubtableRecord::get_extents` to understand how the `BEInt` is being accessed out-of-bounds.",
    "The `IndexSubtable::get_extents` method at line 171 in `hb-ot-color-cbdt-table.hh` currently always returns false. This contradicts the stack trace which shows an access to a `BEInt` object through this method.",
    "The provided code for `IndexSubtable::get_extents` at line 171 in `hb-ot-color-cbdt-table.hh` does not contain the logic that would lead to a `BEInt` access. The crash report's stack trace must refer to a different version or a specific branch of code. I need to re-evaluate the context of the `BEInt` access.",
    "The crash occurs due to an out-of-bounds read when casting an LOffsetTo<IndexSubtable> object to BEInt. The `+` operator on `this` (an IndexSubtableRecord*) with `offsetToSubtable` (an LOffsetTo<IndexSubtable>) results in an `IndexSubtable` pointer. When `get_extents` is called, it might misinterpret the data at that location as a `BEInt` object, leading to the crash.",
    "The crash likely occurs because the addition of 'this' (IndexSubtableRecord*) and 'offsetToSubtable' (LOffsetTo<IndexSubtable>) results in an invalid pointer to an IndexSubtable. This invalid pointer is then used to call get_extents, which internally attempts to read an out-of-bounds BEInt object."
