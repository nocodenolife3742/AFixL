    "The crash is a SEGV caused by reading an out-of-bounds FWORD32 value at hb-machinery.hh:711. The bounds check at hb-aat-layout-kerx-table.hh:244 is incorrect as it subtracts 'this' from the total size, leading to an effective check against header.length rather than the correct boundary. This allows an out-of-bounds `v` pointer to be dereferenced."
