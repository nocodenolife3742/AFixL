    "Reason for requesting line 923 of /src/wireshark/epan/tvbuff.c: To understand how the offset and length are calculated and passed to the underlying `fast_ensure_contiguous` function, which appears to be the source of the SEGV.",
    "Reason for requesting line 1331 of /src/wireshark/epan/dissectors/packet-ber.c: To understand how the offset is calculated before calling `tvb_get_guint8`, which leads to `fast_ensure_contiguous` and the crash.",
    "Reason for requesting line 827 of /src/wireshark/epan/tvbuff.c: To understand the internal logic of `fast_ensure_contiguous` and why it might be triggering a SEGV instead of a clean exception, I need to see the implementation of `fast_ensure_contiguous`.",
    "Reason for requesting line 198 of /src/wireshark/epan/except.c: To understand how exceptions are thrown and if there's any memory access that could be going wrong during the exception handling itself.",
    "Reason for requesting line 156 of /src/wireshark/epan/except.c: To understand the structure of `except_stacknode` and `except_info` to identify how `except_catcher` is stored and potentially corrupted.",
    "The crash occurs during exception handling in `do_throw` while attempting to access `catcher->except_id` (line 198) after `fast_ensure_contiguous` throws `ReportedBoundsError`. This suggests `catcher` or `catcher->except_id` is invalid, possibly due to heap corruption or a dangling pointer, rather than the original bounds error being the direct cause of the SEGV.",
    "Reason for requesting line 1 of /src/wireshark/epan/except.h: To understand the definitions of `except_t`, `except_stacknode`, and `except_catch` and related types in `except.h` to see how `except_id` and `except_info` are structured, which is critical for understanding the crash at line 198 of `except.c`.

The `len` variable, derived from the input, dictates how many subsequent bytes are read. If `len` is large, the `offset` can increment beyond the `tvb`'s bounds, leading to an out-of-bounds read in `tvb_get_guint8` and a subsequent crash (SEGV) during the `THROW(ReportedBoundsError)` process within `fast_ensure_contiguous`. To fix this, a bounds check should be added before the loop that reads the length bytes to ensure `offset + len` does not exceed the `tvb`'s actual length. If it does, a `ReportedBoundsError` should be thrown to prevent the out-of-bounds access.",

      "reason": "The crash occurs when reading a BER length field. The `try_get_ber_length` function reads the length of the length field (`len`) and then loops `len` times to read the actual length bytes. If `len` is excessively large, or if the remaining buffer is smaller than `len`, the `tvb_get_guint8` call inside the loop can attempt to read past the end of the `tvbuff_t`, leading to a SEGV through `fast_ensure_contiguous` and `do_throw`. The fix introduces a check to ensure that the remaining number of bytes in the `tvbuff_t` is sufficient to read all `len` bytes of the BER length field before entering the loop. If not, it explicitly throws a `ReportedBoundsError`.",
