    "The crash is a heap-buffer-overflow caused by writing past a 1-byte allocated buffer. The buffer rar->cstate.window_buf is allocated with size rar->cstate.window_size. The crash report indicates rar->cstate.window_size was 1. The write happens at rar->cstate.window_buf[write_idx & cmask]. If window_size is 1, then window_mask is 0, so write_idx & cmask should be 0. The overflow means write_idx & cmask became 1. This happens if window_size is 0, which would make window_mask -1, leading to an out-of-bounds access.",
